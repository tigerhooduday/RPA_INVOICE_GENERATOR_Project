# RPA_INVOICE_GENERATOR_Project
Overview

The Invoice Generator is a Python web application built with Flask that allows users to generate professional-looking invoices from Excel files. It provides a simple interface for uploading Excel files containing product information, along with customer details such as name, phone number, and date.
